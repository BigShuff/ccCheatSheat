            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>In simple words, if you have multiple CSS <b>selectors</b> for one element,
                    <b>Selector</b>{Property: Value;}
                    the one with the higher specific value will be applied. <i>Note the property and the value together
                        are referred to as a 'declaration'</i>. The
                    selector references the HTML element by its HTML tag e.g. '&lt;div&gt;,&lt;p&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;' or
                    its class e.g. '.myClass' or through its id eg. '#myId'.
                    Browsers award 'selectors' ratings, based on whether an element has been referenced by its tag,
                    class
                    or id. When loading the page the browser will give the
                    selector with the highest rating, 'declaration precedence' when displaying the HTML.

                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS written between HTML &lt;style&gt; tags always takes precedence over CSS written in
                            external files and CSS written with the style attribute of an HTML
                            tag (an inline style) always takes precedence over an HTML &lt;style&gt; tag. So the order
                            of precedence is</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Inline styles</li>
                            <li>Style tags &lt;style&gt;</li>
                            <li>External style sheets</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>In addition browsers process style sheets from top to bottom. This
                            means declarations that appear later in the style sheet overwrite those that came
                            before.</br> E.g.</br><i>.myClass {font-size: 40px; colour: orange;}</br>.myClass
                                {font-size: 20px; colour: green;}</i> </br>As you can see both declarations target the
                            same selector but because the declaration '20px and green' is the
                            last declaration it gets precedence.
                        </li>

                <td>The specificity value can be calculated with the following base 10 guideline, however they are not
                    actually counted using the base 10 system (thousands, hundreds, tens
                    and units etc) however the base 10 system allows us to easily see which takes precedence over the
                    other.

                        <li>Elements and pseudo-elements score 0001 (one) Example
                            &lt;div&gt;,&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;a&gt;,&lt;p&gt; etc. and also pseudo-elements
                            like :before and :after. </li>
                        <li>Class or pseudo-class and attribute selectors score 0010 (ten) Example '.myClass', attribute
                            selectors
                            eg. 'p [class=myHeader]' and also pseudo-classes such as
                            :hover.</li>
                        <li>ID selectors score 0100 (one hundred) Example. '#myid' .
                            Best practice suggests id selectors should only appear once in a single HTML file. Further
                            they should be applied to the most important piece of information in the HTML file.</li>
                        <li>Inline style score 1000 (one thousand) Example &lt;p style="color:#999;"&gt;
                        </li>
